ADNW_PUQ:
- this is a fork from the adnw_k_o_y-Layout

Features:
- Diakritika-Layer for ADNW-PUQ-Layout
- Layer of Layers which allows switching between layers (except diakritika)
- Symbol-Layer: symbols are mirrored -- left = <  and right =  >
- Arrow-Layer for arrrows on the home row
- HJKL-Layer for hjkl on the home row
- Number-Layer for numbers on the home row
- Brackets-Layer for brackets on the home row

Notes:
- all basic-symbols of the german-layout can be found in the Symbol- and Diakritika-Layer
- adnw is a layout optimised for usage with german and english language
- PUQ is a variant of adnw: http://www.adnw.de/index.php?n=Main.OptimierungF%C3%BCrDieGeradeTastaturMitDaumen-Shift 
- This implementation is optimised for my workflow with vim/tmux/xmonad and ergodox
